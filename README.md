# Flask-WebRTC-Virtual-Clinic


## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a web-based platform designed to connect doctors and patients. Using Flask for the backend, the application facilitates real-time communication between doctors and patients through a WebRTC-based video conference. The system includes functionality for managing waiting lists, allowing patients to select and connect with available doctors.

## Features
Flask Backend: The server-side logic is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. Flask handles HTTP requests, data management, and integrates with other services as needed.

Template Rendering: The application uses Jinja2 for rendering HTML templates. These templates dynamically display information such as doctor profiles, patient queues, and appointment details.

Waiting List Management: Patients can join a waiting list to consult with a doctor. The list is dynamically updated as patients join or leave.

Doctor-Patient Matching: The platform automatically matches patients with available doctors based on the waiting list order.

WebRTC Video Conference: Once matched, doctors and patients can engage in a secure, real-time video call facilitated by WebRTC technology, allowing for efficient and personal consultations.

Patient and Doctor Dashboard: Separate dashboards for patients and doctors to view and manage appointments, waiting lists, and video calls.

Database Integration: Integration with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, appointment details, and waiting list information.

Security Features: Implementation of security measures to protect sensitive data, including authentication mechanisms for doctors and patients.
