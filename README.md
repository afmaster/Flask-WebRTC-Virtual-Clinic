# Flask-WebRTC-Virtual-Clinic


## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a web-based platform designed to connect doctors and patients. Using Flask for the backend, the application facilitates real-time communication between doctors and patients through a WebRTC-based video conference. The system includes functionality for managing waiting lists, allowing patients to select and connect with available doctors.

## Features
Flask Backend: The server-side logic is built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. Flask handles HTTP requests, data management, and integrates with other services as needed.

Template Rendering: The application uses Jinja2 for rendering HTML templates. These templates dynamically display information such as doctor profiles, patient queues, and appointment details.

Waiting List Management: Patients can join a waiting list to consult with a doctor. The list is dynamically updated as patients join or leave.

Doctor-Patient Matching: The platform automatically matches patients with available doctors based on the waiting list order.

WebRTC Video Conference: Once matched, doctors and patients can engage in a secure, real-time video call facilitated by WebRTC technology, allowing for efficient and personal consultations.

Patient and Doctor Dashboard: Separate dashboards for patients and doctors to view and manage appointments, waiting lists, and video calls.

Database Integration: Integration with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, appointment details, and waiting list information.

Security Features: Implementation of security measures to protect sensitive data, including authentication mechanisms for doctors and patients.

## Security Notice
:warning: Important Security Considerations: This project involves the use of APIs and the handling of sensitive patient data. As such, it is imperative to implement robust security measures. This includes, but is not limited to, secure handling of API keys, ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest, and adherence to privacy laws and regulations like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) or GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), depending on the region of operation. Failure to adequately secure this data can lead to serious privacy breaches and legal repercussions.
